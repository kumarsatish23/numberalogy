# Technical Documentation for Vasturaksha

## Introduction
Vasturaksha is a web application designed to visualize and analyze data using two matrix charts (Chart A and Chart B). It provides features to highlight specific digits based on a selected date and analyze the occurrence frequency of each digit.

## Features
1. **Date Selection**: Users can select a date using an input field, which triggers the highlighting and analysis process.
2. **Matrix Visualization**: Data is displayed in two matrix charts (Chart A and Chart B) for comparison.
3. **Digit Highlighting**: Digits in the matrices that match the selected date are highlighted for easy identification. The application supports highlighting digits in rows, columns, and diagonals.
4. **Data Analysis**: The application analyzes the highlighted digits to provide insights into their distribution within the matrices. It identifies rows, columns, and diagonals that do not contain highlighted digits, helping users identify patterns and anomalies.
5. **Digit Frequency Analysis**: The occurrence frequency of each digit is presented in a tabular format. Users can quickly understand the distribution of digits across the selected date.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Markup language for structuring the web page.
- **CSS3**: Stylesheet language for designing the user interface.
- **Bootstrap 4**: Front-end framework for responsive design and UI components.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language for interactivity and dynamic content.
